This project is a resource repository in order to allow for a different perspective on Korean reunification which posits as an alternative education project. I wanted to create this project to recast the perspective on Korean division/reunification as a neutral topic which is easier to talk about without confronting historical material realities of how division came to be, which this project would seek to address by providing resources that might otherwise be difficult to access. I would picture this project as being an alternative to a bland neoliberal erasure of material realities, to provide an alternative perspective on what Korean reunification is, who it matters to, why it’s important, etc. I’d picture this as being open to the public and using language as accessible as possible, while centering nuance and seeing Korean reunification as a lens with which to provide insight into Korean history, seeing reunification as a future connected to pasts of how the leaders of the North and South came into power (anti-Japanese war hero vs. U.S. puppet), and interferences as proof of extant colonization, etc. It would draw importance from this and respond to this issue by making its argument that a peaceful future requires recognition of colonial pasts in a unique way.
