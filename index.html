    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p> Week 1: The “Cataloguing Change” reading seems to reflect the simple fact that marginalized peoples are often leaders in the creative arts and humanities, although from an overly simplistic view of men vs women, with little to no mention of any womans’ sexuality or race, creating the sensation of whiteness and straightness and cisness in the absence of mentioning otherwise (regardless of fact), which is odd when it is recognizing the contributions of women to the field as opposed to men, when some women, and other queer/poc artists for that matter, face significant challenges compared to the white cishet woman. That being said, it also calls to mind Pauline Oliveros as one of the leaders of Western sound art in the 60s-70s alongside this reading of earlier Western computer artists, and creates a distinct sense of how white cishet women in America(?) from the 60s and on were approaching integrating technology into their art practice, which is something plenty of artists struggle with even now as advancements continue. The “Artist and Computer” reading differs mainly by simply including men and giving a more in depth look into the specific art practices and approaches of each artist, which may be more effective at arguing for the validity, value, beauty of an emerging art form. What value does computer art present in an increasingly technological world? Does the term “computer art” or “digital art” still feel relevant? Should it be described differently? What about these womens’ art practice may have been different depending on access to technology or socioeconomic status? </p>
    <p> Week 2: While I did appreciate the recognition that technological advancement is not always beneficial when it comes at human cost and is built for malicious intents and it's true that the formation of Silicon Valley relied on US federal government defense funds and was completely centered around cishet white male intellectualism, and I can appreciate the recognition of this, I’m hesitant to accept the blackness of a screen alternative as a metaphor for an ideological change. I’m drawing on Tuck & Yang’s “Decolonization is not a metaphor” as the basis of my logic. Proposing a black screen does not bring with it any sort of change simply by its implementation, and it would be remiss to attach any meanings of racial justice when those developing this proposal are mostly white people—it would completely depend on those proposing it as well. How much change can be implemented through technological shifts themselves? How, to your knowledge, has tech likewise developed to phase out marginalized groups? Is the white screen more accessible than the black screen? </p>
    <p> Week 3: Becoming self-referential and omnipotent, the way we perceive the Internet has changed — and its these qualities that have created profit (internet traffic and data mining for each respectively), and its the mediation of the screen that makes the more privileged vulnerable to in-your-face criticism marginalized groups are much more familiar with (Odell). We were also never meant to have such a powerful centralized server—these are the kinds of things the government reserves for itself until it is more profitable to sell it. Simultaneously, it is possible to create experiences or curate your own experiences within the confines of an oppressive commercial Internet by understanding its structure and how your experience is created already (Ye). What does this call to mind thinking about algorithm development and experience design/curation? How does the hauntology of our first perceptions of the Internet continue to culturally affect us? What is one way you make your online experiences bearable? </p>
    <p> Week 4: Lauren McCarthy’s “Following project” is invested in the play on “following”, a nonconsensual stalkership meant to play the foil to a consensual performance - the account, and the follower. McCarthy then relates the sensation of home, finding home, and finding it through the strangers she literally follows around New York. She also discussed “Lauren” - a human Alexa, to argue the contradiction between fearing the surveillance of AI and omnipotent corporations versus our willing performance on social media. Both are subject to nonconsensual manipulation and data mining by oligarchal corporations, but the performance itself is something the user is willing to have an audience for during one, and not the other. Evil actions of corporations do not make the Instagram user hypocritical for posting themselves, because the two situations are different, though data should not be sold and manipulated without the user’s consent in the first place. What does the future of social media algorithms and data mining look like? How has the social function of the Internet survived amidst the exponential growth of social media platforms? How should consent play a part in data legislation? </p>
    <p> Week 5: The leading question “Is a Museum a Factory” immediately stuck out to me for its situating of the art site within a labor context, art labor is discussed but the move from the factory as a political theater to the museum without necessarily assuming that this means a depoliticization is a very interesting take from the onset for a lot of reasons. “Before: an industrial workplace. Now: people spending their leisure time in front of monitors. Before: people working in these factories. Now: people working at home in front of computer monitors” and “An art space is a factory, which is simultaneously a supermarket—a casino and a place of worship whose reproductive work is performed by cleaning ladies and cellphone-video bloggers alike” with “In this economy, even spectators are transformed into workers” are so visceral it’s ridiculous. Third World Cinema was concerned with a Marxist aesthetic and a focus on labor, and it’s ironic how the site of the cinema, the factory, has simply evolved into another factory, the material relation to the author’s logics being the literal fascination with sites of labor like old whitewashed factories with big black factory doors by galleries and museums. It is a wonderful logic to apply to late stage capitalist way of life, the stream of the worker from factory to museum, the museum being the act of spectacle that constitutes most of laborer downtime while being labor producing value. And this museum, whether the physical museum or the act of spectacle at home however unglamorous, are both concealed, unfilmed and therefore culturally invisible. It is a central paradox which supports the author’s claim that “instead of its ideal manifestation, the contemporary museum rather represents its unfulfilled reality” chained by time-based audiovisual-based installation that competes and distracts and repels, a liberal’s radicalism is creating something tangible. Another quote: “What else is desperately missing from the museum-as-factory? An exit. If the factory is everywhere, then there is no longer a gate by which to leave it—there is no way to escape relentless productivity. Political cinema could then become the screen through which people could leave the museum-as-social-factory. But on which screen could this exist? On the one that is currently missing, of course”. Everything about this reading from a curatorial and Marxist perspective is counterintuitively thrilling, its all encompassing economic pessimism exciting to read, a textual healing force on labor alienation in the age of spectacle and the magical unreality that the art space becomes. The second section thinks about the fundamental aspect of protest as a communication, one that is articulated verbally, visually. Rather than art “as [political theory’s] ornament”, “we conversely relate a form of artistic production, namely the theory of montage, to the field of politics? In other words, how is the political field edited?” And how this is produced through a chain of production, another factory labor analysis? </p>
    <p> Week 6: Joy Buolamwini in her Ted Talk “How I’m fighting bias in algorithms” touches on a increasingly prevalent problem as facial recognition software has become increasingly prevalent in day to day life – the inherent bias of coders that leads to software she was working on that did not detect her own face due to its situation outside a certain range of color and shape, an issue that’s been widely discussed since Apple first released it’s facial recognition unlocking software that failed to differentiate between twin sisters in China. Buolamwini coins this situation as the “coded gaze”, and through her experiences as an MIT grad student pushes for a need to keep coders and software engineers accountable. Have you personally been affected by the coded gaze? How can we imagine wider repercussions of the coded gaze? Why has this been continually allowed to happen? </p>
    <p> Week 7: The Ross piece includes a quote that states “Reindigenization is not a repeat of the past, it is the revolutionary/evolutionary RETURN to ways of life with and for the land” before describing methods of establishing “nonviolent creative code” through largely understandings drawn from disability justice frameworks in awareness of the body, labor, resources, and materiality — which does not entail decolonization. Colonization, as a violent and dispossessing event, can only be undone by revolutionary return of land (see “Decolonization is not a metaphor” by Tuck & Yang). I can’t help but think aside from this misappropriation of decolonization, or in this case reindigenization (implying a return to ways of life with and for land, in an attempt to emulate Indigenous ways of life through labor ethics and disability justice practices?) that disregarding the actual frameworks that this manifesto draws on can only hurt the intentions behind the questions being asked and make blurrier material structures laid down by past organizers on how to make these ideals reality, as is my main concern with any discussion surrounding “digital colonialism” that fails to center material realities, looking at the problem of digital activism from the lens of indigenous and transnational studies. Discussion Qs: how could digital thoughts function as extensions of disability justice? How could they contribute to indigenous efforts? How could they center indigenous voices? How would they look different if they did so, as opposed to “reindigenizing” whiteness? </p>
    <p> Week 8: I thought it was interesting to rethink a perspective on design from the ideal being universal design to taking a historical and materialist approach to the reality that different things mean different people, and that the ideal way to design with the audience in mind is in fact to design alongside them, in contrast to imposing the most perfect, most rational, most universal solution while combining this with ideas of indigenous intelligence through centering sustainability, proposing a defocusing of human-centered design, raising ecologically-centered design as a new direction for undoing the neoliberal logics of the designs of the 20th century. 1) What are some ways that Melenciano’s ideas could be applied to your personal design practice? 2) In what ways can you compare Melenciano’s differences with the police state as written by Wang in “Carceral Capitalism”? 3) What are some ways that “omni-specialized design” can combat police spying/service organizations like Stop LAPD Spying Coalition? </p>
    <p> Week 9: This TED Talk reminded me of a reading on the ways that designing for accessibility always enriches design/experiences for all people, and that understanding disabilities has always driven innovation, and the way Kim describes the way she finds similarities between music and American Sign Language in their visual notations of meaning I feel is something I would never have been able to think of as a hearing person. I also really appreciated the ways in which she brings up more about sound beyond literally what is heard, thinking about all of its other qualities that affect what we hear, and corroborating that with our understandings of others around us utilizing sign language and thinking about all the ways in which we experience not only what we hear but how we navigate power structures in who is given attention using the term “social currency” to think about capitalist structures of interaction as well. 1) What part of the TED talk surprised you? 2) Do you think of how much space you take up when you enter into a conversation, or different peoples’ abilities/ways of engaging? 3) How can this understanding be applied to other disabilities that are not just physical that may affect how we interact? </p>
