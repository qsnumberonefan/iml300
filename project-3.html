    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p> Concept description: I feel like as of now Korean reunification has been made a neutral topic where political stances are avoided,
    perhaps in fears of threatening agreement between two politically different states while under US power. I would picture this project
    as being an alternative to a bland neoliberal erasure of material realities, to provide an alternative perspective on what Korean
    reunification is, who it matters to, why it’s important, etc. I’d picture this as being open to the public and using language as
    accessible as possible, while centering nuance and seeing Korean reunification as a lens with which to provide insight into Korean history,
    seeing reunification as a future connected to pasts of how the leaders of the North and South came into power (anti-Japanese war hero vs. U.S. puppet),
    and interferences as proof of extant colonization, etc. It would draw importance from this and make its argument that a peaceful
    future requires recognition of colonial pasts in a unique way. </p>
